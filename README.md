# Mobile Charging Station

## Project Overview

This repository contains the complete implementation of the **Mobile Charging Station** project developed as part of the **ETE 320 – Microprocessor and Microcontroller Sessional** course at the Department of Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering, Chittagong University of Engineering & Technology (CUET).

The project focuses on designing a **coin-based multi-port mobile charging system** with optional **RFID-based authenticated access**, intended for use in public environments such as universities, transportation hubs, and commercial areas.

## Abstract

The increasing demand for public mobile charging facilities requires solutions that ensure controlled usage, secure access, and efficient power management. This project presents a coin-based multi-port mobile charging station built around an **ESP32 DevKit microcontroller**. The system integrates a **CH616 multi-coin acceptor** for time-bound, coin-operated charging and an **RFID module** for authenticated access to a dedicated charging port. Relay-controlled USB charging ports enable multiple users to charge devices simultaneously, while an LCD interface provides real-time system feedback. The design is modular, scalable, and suitable for real-world deployment.

## Objectives

* Design a controlled public mobile charging system
* Implement coin-operated, time-bound charging logic
* Integrate RFID-based authenticated charging access
* Enable independent control of multiple charging ports
* Ensure safe and efficient power delivery

## Components Used

* **ESP32 DevKitC** – Main controller
* **CH616 Multi-Coin Acceptor** – Coin detection and validation
* **4-Channel Relay Module** – Independent port switching
* **USB Charging Modules** – Regulated power output
* **RFID Module** – Secure authenticated access
* **LCD Display (I2C)** – System status and time display
* **Push Button** – Port selection and user input
* **Power Adapter** – AC to DC conversion

## System Operation

### Coin-Based Charging Mode

1. User inserts a valid coin.
2. Coin acceptor generates pulses detected by the ESP32.
3. User selects a charging port.
4. Corresponding relay activates and charging starts.
5. LCD displays remaining charging time.
6. Charging automatically stops when time expires.

### RFID-Based Charging Mode

* Authorized RFID card activates a dedicated charging port.
* Provides secure, contactless access without coin insertion.

## Simulation & Implementation

* **Simulation Platform**: Wokwi (coin-based logic)
* Verified correct sequencing of coin detection, port selection, timing, and automatic shutdown.
* **Practical Implementation**: Hardware prototype using ESP32, relay modules, coin acceptor, LCD, and charging ports.

## Limitations

* Possible false coin pulses due to mechanical or electrical noise
* Relay-based switching introduces mechanical wear
* Fixed charging current (no adaptive power management)
* No digital or mobile payment integration
* Breadboard-based prototype not suitable for long-term deployment

## Future Improvements

* Integration of mobile financial services (MFS)
* Smart power management and adaptive charging
* Solid-state switching instead of mechanical relays
* Enclosed, rugged hardware design
* IoT-based monitoring and analytics
